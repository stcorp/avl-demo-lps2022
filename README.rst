LPS2022 AVL demo
================

These are the notebooks that were used in the Atmosphere Virtual Lab demo during the ESA Living Planet Symposium 2022 in Bonn.

To run the notebooks, create a new avl-demo conda environment and start jupyterlab using: ::

  $ conda create -n avl-demo
  $ conda activate avl-demo
  $ conda install -c conda-forge atmosphere-virtual-lab
  $ jupyter-lab

You can then open each notebook .md file by right-clicking on them in the jupyterlab file browser and selecting "Open With", "Notebook".
